## IMPORTANT:
I am moving this repo from github to codeberg, and will eventually remove the github repo in the near future.
For now, the github repo will act as a mirror for the codeberg one.
All pull requests and bug reports should be done on codeberg, which can be found [here](https://codeberg.org/rjust/ReCoil/src/branch/devel). 

## A simple arcade shooter in zero-gravity.

Shoot through waves of different enemy types and manage your velocity through a small but fun 0-gravity shooter!
You can't move on your own, so you need to rely on the recoil of your shotgun to move!
Just be sure you don't shoot too much, or you will bounce around wildy out of control.
